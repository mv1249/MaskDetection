# MaskDetection
This is a simple Deeplearning model which uses Convulution Neural Network and predicts from the image whether the person is wearing a mask or not
Upload an image of a person to the model and the model will predict whether the person is wearning mask or not...the accuracy is not that perfect,but yes it can accurately predict upto 70%
